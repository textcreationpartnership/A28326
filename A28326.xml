         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcript.] <hi>The firſt kind is a thorny tree, ſet full of ſharp prickles amongſt which do ariſe the leaves ſet full of other ſmall leaves, the flowers are white, the ſeed is broad like Lupines, incloſed in long Cods, out of which they draw a juice or black liquor; which is called</hi> Acatia.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond kind is alſo a thorny plant, ſet with long ſhary prickles, and the leaves be almoſt like the leaves of Common Rue; the fruit is likewiſe incloſed in Cods like that of the firſt kind, there is a gum iſſueth out of this tree which is called</hi> Gum-Arabick, <hi>very well known here, but the liquor or Juice, is hardly known; for inſtead of this true</hi> Acatia, <hi>they uſe in ſhops the Juice of</hi> Sloes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nature and Vertues.] Acatia,</hi> eſpecially the Juice, is dry in the third degree and cold in the firſt, and under the planet <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Place.]</hi> The Monks-hood or blew Wolfs-bane is very common in many Gardens, the other rarely found but in the Gardens of ſome curious herbariſts; but groweth in Forreſts and dark low woods and Valleys in ſome parts of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>To every 100 of <hi>Cacao's,</hi> put two cods of long red Pepper, one handful of Anniſeeds; one cod of <hi>Campeche</hi> or Logwood, two drams of Cinnamon; Almonds and Haſel-nuts of each a dozen, white Sugar half a pound; and if you cannot have thoſe things which come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> you may make it with the reſt.</p>

                     <head>The way of compounding the Chocholate.</head>
                     <p>The <hi>Cacao,</hi> and other ingredients muſt be beaten in a ſtone morter, or grownd upon abroad ſtone, which the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Metate,</hi> and is made onely for that uſe; ſuch ſtones as our Painters grind their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours upon will ſerve for that uſe, the firſt thing that is to be done is to dry the ingredients, with care that, in ſtirring, they be not burnt nor become black; and if they be over dried, then they will be bitter and loſe their vertue: the Cinnamon and the long red Pepper, are to be firſt beaten, with the Anniſeed; and then beat the <hi>Cacao,</hi> by little and little till it be all powdered, and ſometimes turn it round in the beating that it may mix the better; and every one of theſe ingredients muſt be beaten by it ſelf; and then put them all into the veſſel where the <hi>Cacao</hi> is; which you muſt ſtir together, &amp; then take out that paſte, &amp; put it into the morter, under which you muſt lay a little fire, after the confection it made: But you muſt be very careful, not to put more fire than will warm it, that the unctuous parts do not fly away, you muſt ſearſe all the ingredients, but onely the <hi>Cacoa,</hi> and when you find it to be wel beaten and incorporated (which you ſhall know by the ſhortneſs of it) then with a ſpoon take up ſome of the paſte which will be almoſt liquid, and ſo either make it into tablets, or rowles, or put it into boxes, and when it is cold it will be hard. To make the Tablets you muſt put a ſpoonful of the paſte, upon a ſheet of Paper; the <hi>Indians</hi> put it upon a leaf, where being put in the ſhade it grows hard, and then howing the Paper the Tablets fall off, by reaſon of the fatneſs of the paſte: but if it be put into any thing of earth or wood, it will ſtick faſt, and will not come off, without ſcraping or breaking.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Indies</hi> they take it two ſeveral wayes: the one being the common way is, to take it hot, with <hi>Atolle,</hi> which was the drink of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Indians,</hi> (they call <hi>Atolle</hi> pap, made of the flower of <hi>Maiz,</hi> and ſo they mingle it with the Chocholate,): the other modern way which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſe, is of two ſorts; the one is, that the Chocholate being diſſolved with cold water, and the ſcum taken off, and put into another
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54089:25"/> Veſſel, they put the remainder upon the Fire with Sugar; and when it is warm, then they pour it upon the ſcum they tooke off before, and ſo drink it: the other way is to warm the water; and then when you have put into a pot or diſh, aſmuch Chocholate as you think fit, put in a little of the warm water, and then grind it well with the Molinet, and when it is well ground put the reſt of the warm water to it, and ſo drink it with Sugar, to your taſt.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe former wayes there are others: one is, put the Chocho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late into a pipkin, with a little water and let it boyl well until it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and then put in ſufficient water and Sugar, according to the quality of the Chocholate, and then boyl it again until there comes an oyly ſcum upon it; and then drink it.</p>
                     <p>There is another way to drink Chocholate, which is cold; and takes its name from the principal ingredient and is called <hi>Cacao,</hi> which they uſe at Feaſts to refreſh themſelves, and it is made after this manner.</p>
                     <p>The Chocholate being diſſolved in water with the Molinet, take off the ſcum or craſſy part which riſeth in great quantity, when the <hi>Cacao</hi> is older and more putrified, the ſcum is laid aſide by it ſelf in a little diſh, and then put Sugar into that pan from whence you took the ſcum, and pour it from on high upon the ſcum, and ſo drink it cold, but this drink doth not agree with all Stomacks, by reaſon of its coldneſs.</p>
                     <p>There is another way to drink it cold, which is called <hi>Cacao penali;</hi> and it is done by adding to the ſame Chocholate (having made the confection, as is before ſet down) ſo much <hi>Maiz,</hi> dried and well grownd, and taken from the husk, and then well-mingled in the morter, with the Chocholat, it falls all into flower or duſt, and ſo theſe things being mingled as is ſaid before there riſeth the ſcum; and ſo take it, and drink it, as before.</p>
                     <p>There is another way, which is a ſhort and quicker way to make it, which is more wholſom; that is, firſt to ſet ſome water to warm, and while it warms, throw a Tablet, or ſome Chocholate ſcraped and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Sugar, into a little cup, and when the water is hot pour the water to the Chocholate, and then diſſolve it with the Molinet, and then without taking off the ſcum drink it.</p>
                     <p>But in our colder Country moſt uſually it is thus made with milk, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of water, and ſome add yolks of Eggs, and a ſop of white Bread.</p>
                     <p>Such as deſire to take it in milk, three ounces of Chocolate will be ſufficient to a quart of milk; ſcrape the Chocolate very fine, and put it into the milk when it boyles; work it very well with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called <hi>Molenillo,</hi> between your hands; which inſtrument muſt be of wood, with a round knob, made very round, and cut ragged, that as you turn it in your hands, the milk may froth, and diſſolve the Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the better; then ſet the milk on the fire again, untill it be ready to boyl, having the yolk of two eggs, well beaten with ſome of the hot milk, then put your eggs into the milk, and Chocolate and Sugar, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54089:25"/> as you like for your taſt, &amp; work it altogether with the Molinet, and thus drink it: or, if you pleaſe, you may ſlice a little manchet into a diſh, and ſo eat it for a breakfaſt: you may if you pleaſe make it alſo with water inſtead of milk, after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Set a pot of conduit-water over the fire untill it boyles; then to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon that is to drink, put an ounce of Chocolate, with aſmuch Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar into every pot, whereunto pour a pint of the ſaid water ſo boyling and therein work together the Chocolate and the Sugar, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument called <hi>El-Molenillo,</hi> until it be throughly incorporated; which done pour in as many half pints of the ſaid water, as there be ounces of the Chocolate; and if you pleaſe you may put in the yolks of one or two new-laid eggs, which muſt be beaten untill they froth very much: the hotter it is drunk, the better it is; you may likewiſe put in a ſlice of white-bread or biſket, and eat that with the Chocolate, which will be a very ſubſtantial and Cordial breakfaſt.</p>

                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> The firſt kind called the great Dragon, or Serpentary, beareth an upright ſtalk of a cubit long or more; thick, round-ſmooth, and ſpeckled; with divers colours and ſpots; like to an Adder, or Snakes skin: the leavs be great and large, compact or made of ſix, ſeaven, or more leaves, whereof each ſingle leaf, is long, and like to a ſorrel or Dock-leaf, and are very ſmooth and plain: at the top of the ſtalk groweth, a long hoſe or husk, like to the hoſe or Cod of Cuckow-pintle, or Wake-robin, of a greeniſh colour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and of a dark red or purple colour within, and ſo is the clapper, or peſtle that groweth up within the ſaid husk, which is long, and thick, and ſhart-pointed, peeked like to a horn; whoſe fruit by increaſe waxeth ſo as it ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54089:31"/> and at length breaketh out of a certain skin, or Film; and appeareth like to a bunch or cluſter of Grapes; which at the firſt are green, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards become very red: theſe berries or Grapes are full of juice or liquor; in which is a certain ſmall hard ſeed; the root of this Dragon is laſting, thick and white, and groweth like to a <hi>Bulbous Onion,</hi> covered with a thin skin, and of the quantity of a middle-ſiz'd apple, and bearded with divers little white hairs or ſtrings; and oftentimes there is joyning to it other ſmall roots which ſpring out of it, whereby it is multiplied.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſmaller Dragon in his leaves, husk, or Cod, peſtil, or clapper, berry, and Grape, is like unto <hi>Aron,</hi> or Cuckow-pintle; ſaving that his leaves are not marked with black, but with white ſpots; neither do they periſh ſo ſoon as Cuckow-pintle, but they grow together with their berries until Winter.</p>
                  <p>Their berries alſo are not fully ſo red, but of a certain yellowiſh red: the root is not much unlike the root of <hi>Aron,</hi> white and round like an <hi>Onion,</hi> and hath certain hairy threds hanging by it, with ſome ſmall roots or buds of new plants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Water-Dragon hath not a round <hi>Bulbous</hi> root like the other Dragons, but it is a long creeping root, full of joints, and of a good thickneſs, out of which joints ſpringeth up the ſtalks of the leaves, which are ſmooth without, and ſpongy within; but downwards towards the ground, the ſaid roots ſend out of their ſaid joints, certain ſmall hairy, or threddy roots; the fruit grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alone upon a ſhort ſtem; and cometh forth with one of the leaves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with white ſmall thrommes or threds; at the firſt, (which is the blowing) and afterward it groweth forth into a cluſter, which is green at firſt and waxeth red when it is ripe; ſmaller then Grapes or cluſter of Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kow-pintle berries, but as ſharp or biting: the leaves be large, green, fine, ſmooth, faſhioned like Ivy leaves, yet ſmaller than the leaves of Cuckow-pintle, but that leaf wherein the cluſter of berries groweth, is ſmalleſt of all; and on the upper part or ſide next the fruit, it is white.</p>

Of the hard fort there is ſome difference: for that which is gathered in <hi>Arabia</hi> differeth from that in <hi>Perſia,</hi> being in ſmall grains ſomewhat like unto <hi>Coriander-ſeeds,</hi> and is gathered as <hi>Rauwolfius</hi> ſaith, from thoſe trees the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Agul</hi> or <hi>Alhagi.</hi> Another ſort is reddiſh and gathered from herbs and plants. That of <hi>Perſia</hi> is called <hi>Xireast, lac Arborum,</hi> that is, milk of trees, and is white like that of <hi>Calabria,</hi> whereof ſome is as ſmall as Hemp-ſeed, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as big as Almond-Comfits, another ſort is gathered in <hi>Armenia</hi> in great lumps of a browniſh colour. Another ſort is affirmed by <hi>Aphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſeus (cited</hi> by <hi>Niger</hi>) that, falling as an hony-dew on mount <hi>Libanus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> it is by the heat of the Sun congealed into an hard Sugar which the inhabitants call <hi>Saccar:</hi> from whence came the Latine word <hi>Saccharum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have been, and ſome ſtill are of the opinion, that ſome of theſe ſmaller white ſorts might be the <hi>Manna</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wherewith they were fed in the Wilderneſs, and therefore called Bread; But the Scripture doth flatly contradict ſuch conceits, with divers reaſons. 1. The Manna which was given to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to eat, had no purging out a Nutritive quality. 2. It was not ſo ſweet as ours, in taſt. 3. It fell not on their Sabbaths, although it did all the week after. 4. It
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54089:67"/> fell all the year long, and not, as our <hi>Manna</hi> doth, in the Summer only. 5. It vaniſhed away as ſoon as it felt the heat of Sun, but the Sun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſeth and hardneth ours. 6. It would putrifie, if it were kept but two dayes beſides the Sabbath day. And laſtly, that <hi>Manna</hi> ceaſed to fall any more after they had eaten of the Corn of the Land.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>Manna</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> called <hi>Calabrina:</hi> great controverſies have been amongſt writers whether it be a dew condenſate by the cold of the night, or whether it be a gum iſſuing from trees, being cut as other trees that yeeld gums are; ſome do affirm, that it is only gathered from the manured or Wild Aſh. The Liquid ſort is gathered both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> but that of the <hi>Levant</hi> is more plentiful, and more opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: it is gathered in divers other Countries both of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> (beſides <hi>Calabria,</hi> where no Aſh-trees grow.) from many other trees, and differs in drines, form of greater or leſſer peeces, and colour, as it is altered by the diſpoſition and temperature of the Climate, either hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or colder.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Kinds.]</hi> THere are of Muſhrooms or Toad-ſtools two ſorts, one called wholſome or edible Muſhrooms, becauſe they are often pickled and eaten, rather out of idle and vain curioſity than for any goodneſs that is in them; And the poyſonous or deadly Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools. Of the edible kind there are numbred amongſt Authours two and thirty ſorts, they are called in Latine <hi>fungus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcript.] <hi>I ſhall not ſtand to deſcribe all the various forms of theſe</hi> Muſhrooms, <hi>but only a word or two of the most uſual; The moſt uſual ſorts have ſmall ſmooth round heads, ſtanding upon thick ſhort ſtalks, and are for the moſt part white, yet in ſome the upper skin is browniſh, or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but generally more yellow when they are decaying, most of them are ſomewhat flat and hollow underneath, with many lines running directly from the middle to the edges round about; the ſubſtance of them generally is looſe and ſpongy, the taſte of them is according to the Soil of the place where they grow; for thoſe that grow in our own Land, in open Champion fields and Meadows, are ſafer from danger and of better relliſh, than thoſe of the ſame kinds that grow in Woods and under trees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of this kind grow bigger than others, and ſome more topped or ſpiring; ſome are parted as it were all over into ſundry diviſions, making it ſeem like unto an Honey-comb, and therefore are called <hi>Favaginoſi:</hi> Another ſort is more ſharp ſmall and ſpiring than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the edible kinds; another ſort is round ſoft and whitiſh, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſlit on the edges moſt uſually, and are called St. <hi>Georges</hi> Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms; becauſe they grow up uſually about that time. There are a great many other ſorts too tedious for my intention in this work, but for the quality and property of them all, <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, they have a more earthy than watry ſubſtance, breeding groſs and melancholly humours; and they that eat much of them are ſubject to the <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> and <hi>Palſie,</hi> beſides they are hard of digeſtion, and trouble the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach which way ſoever dreſſed; whether boyled, ſtewed, pickled or eaten with pepper oyl and vinegar.</p>
                  <p>But to cauſe that the edible Muſhrooms may be leſs offenſive, (and many do greedily deſire them;) It is held that if they be boyled with wild Pears, they may be eaten without danger, or for want of wild Pears to take a harder and harſher ſort of other pears, the leaves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and bark are conducing to that purpoſe, and ſo is Garlick and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.</p>
                  <p>All the ſorts of Muſhrooms called edible, that is, that may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, are all but at the beſt dangerous, if not poyſonous; there are a great many ſorts more called <hi>fungi pernicioſi,</hi> hurtful poyſonous and deadly Muſhrooms; but half of them grow not in our Land; yet ſome
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54089:73"/> of them do; and ſo much reſemble, and are like unto ſome of the edible ſorts, that they deceive many that gather them, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are a ſpeedy death to thoſe that eat them; therefore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is addicted to the delight of them, let them beware upon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; that although many may be found of a pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſhew in our own Countrey aswel as in others, yet the danger of the beſt is ſuch, that many by eating them have died remedileſs.</p>
                  <p>There are likewiſe kinds of Muſhrooms which are Excreſcencies growing about the ſtems of trees, as about old Willows, Oakes, and Hazels, which are called Touch-woods; theſe grow harder than the others, and are of a dry fungous or ſpongy ſubſtance on the inſide, that they may be cut or broken into ſeveral pieces, having a hard or woody cruſt on the outſide, and are of differing forms and colours, ſome being very great and flat at the head, and ſmaller and rounder underneath; of a browniſh yellow colour the way to make Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of them is to boyl them once or twice in Lye made of Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes; and afterwards being dryed and broken in pieces, they are kept, ſerving to take fire like Lynt or Tynder.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Kinds and Names.]</hi> THere are ſeveral ſorts of Pepper, as black, white, and long Pepper; called <hi>Piper nigrum, album, &amp; longum.</hi> The black and white Pepper differeth not either in manner of growing or in form of leaf or fruit; the long pepper alſo doth grow after the ſame manner, but differeth in the fruit: All theſe ſorts do grow each on a ſeveral climing buſh, in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> but after one manner, that is, as Hops do grow with us; ſo that if they be not ſuſtained by ſome tree or Pole on which they may climb &amp; ſpread, they will lye down on the ground &amp; thereon run and ſhoot forth ſmall fibers at every joynt. But the uſual manner is to Plant a branch taken from the Buſh, near to ſome tall tree, great Cane or Pole, and ſo it will quickly by winding it ſelf about it get to the top thereof being full of joynts; and ſhooting forth fair large leaves one at a joynt, being almoſt round, but ending in a point, green above, and paler underneath, with a great middle rib, and four other ribs ſomewhat leſſer, ſpreading from it, two on each ſide, and ſmaller veins therein alſo unto the edges, which are ſmooth and plain, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thin, and ſet on a pretty long footſtalk; the fruit or pepper it ſelf, whether black, white, or long, groweth at the ſame joynt; but on the contrary ſide oppoſite to the leaf, (and not between the ſtalk and the leaf as ſome have falſly deſcribed it) round about a long ſtalk ſomewhat thinly ſet all along thereon, or not ſo thick as a bunch of grapes; the root hath ſundry joynts creeping in the ground with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres at the joynts, the white pepper is hardly diſtinguiſhed from the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54089:80"/> black, by the very plants thereof, until it come to ripeneſs; (for the white and black Pepper do grow on ſeveral buſhes,) but that the leaves are of a little paler green colour; the grains or berries are white, ſolid, firm without wrinkles, and more aromatical. The long Pepper hath leaves very near to the ſame form and bigneſs, but a little longer-pointed, of a paler green colour, thinner alſo, and with a ſhorter footſtalk, and not having four ſo eminent ribs paſſing from the middle-one as in the other; but four or five or more ſometimes on each ſide, according to the largeneſs of the leaf, with other ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler veins therein, and with leſſer acrimony and hot taſte than the black; the fruit of this alſo groweth in like manner at the joynts, oppoſite to each leaf, which are cloſer ſet together than in the black; being ſome greater or leſſer, ſhorter or longer than others; conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many ſmall grains as it were ſet cloſe together in rowes, and not open and ſeparate as in the black and white pepper; of an Aſh-colour when it is ripe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Government and Vertues.]</hi> All the Peppers are under the dominion of <hi>Mars,</hi> and of temperature hot and dry almoſt in the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but the white Pepper is the hotteſt, which ſort is of much uſe both with the <hi>Indians</hi> and other nations. The <hi>Indians</hi> uſe to chew the leaves ſpitting it out again, as ſome amongſt us do Tobacco; and the pepper it ſelf they alſo chew, and from the branch take every grain one after another while they are freſh.</p>
                  <p>Pepper is much uſed with us in meats and ſawces, which it very well doth if not taken too much at once; and comforteth and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a cold ſtomach, conſumeth crude and moiſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours therein,<note place="margin">Stomach, Wind, Bowels, Cough, Breaſt, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Poiſons.</note> and ſtirreth up the appetite; It hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to break or diſſolve wind in the ſtomach or bowels, to provoke Urine, to help the Cough, and other diſeaſes of the breaſt, and is effectual againſt the bitings of Serpents and other poiſons, and to that purpoſe it is an ingredient in the great Antidotes: but the white pepper as being more white ſharp and aromatical, is of more effect in medicines; and ſo is the long, being more uſed to be given for Agues to warm the ſtomach, before the coming of the fit, thereby to abate the ſhaking thereof; All of them are uſed againſt the Quinſie, being mixed with honey,<note place="margin">Quinſie, Kernels.</note> and taken inwardly aſwell as applyed outwardly, and diſperſeth the kernels aswell in the throat as in the other parts of the body.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>They do not ſow them in the hot Countries before the end of</hi> March <hi>or beginning of</hi> April, <hi>and at the ſooneſt they do not flower before the beginning of</hi> Auguſt: <hi>and their beautiful red Cods ripen not thorowly, until the beginning of Winter, and ſo will abide both with flower and fruit, moſt of the Winter with them in the warmer Regions; but in our colder Climates they preſently periſh with the firſt froſt, and therefore muſt be carefully houſed, if any will preſerve them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Government and Vertues.] <hi>All theſe ſorts of Pepper are under the Planetary Regiment of</hi> Mars, <hi>and are of a fiery hot and ſharp biting taſte, and of temperature hot and dry, to the end of the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; they burn and inflame the Mouth and Throat ſo extreamly that it is hard to be endured; and if it be outwardly applyed to the ſkin in any part of the body, it will exulcerate it, and raiſe bliſters as if it had been burnt with fire or ſcalded with hot Water. The fierce va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours that ariſe from the huſks or Cods, while one doth but open them to take out the ſeed (eſpecially if they do but beat them into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or onely bruiſe them) will ſo peirce the brain by flying up into the Head through the Noſtrils, that it will procure violent</hi> Sneeſings,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54089:82"/> 
                     <hi>and draw down abundance of thinn Rhueme, forcing teares from the Eyes in abundance; and will all paſſe into the Throat, and provoke a ſharp Coughing, and cauſe ſuch violent Vomiting, that the very Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells aſwel as the Stomack, will be much perplexed with it: &amp; if any ſhall with their hands touch their Face or Eyes, it will cauſe ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation both in the Face and Eyes, that it will not be remedied in a long time, by all the bathing thereof with Wine or cold Water, that can be uſed, but yet will paſſe away without further harm. If any of it be caſt into the fire, it raiſeth grievous ſtrong &amp; noiſome Vapours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Sneezings very fiercely and Coughing &amp; ſtrong Vomiting, to all that be neer unto it; if it ſhould be taken ſimply of it ſelf, (though in a very ſmall quantity, either in powder or decoction) it were ſcarce to be endured and would prove very dangerous to Life.</hi>

                     <hi>Deſcription and Names.]</hi> THere is one ſort called the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Pines, called in Latine <hi>Anana ſeu Pina,</hi> and another ſort called <hi>Anana Silvestris,</hi> Wild-Indian Pines.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Pines (which for their excellent and pleaſant ſweet fruit are much eſteemed in all the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>) are the fruit of a kind of thiſtle, growing with many long, hard, rough, ſtiffe and narrow leaves thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the middle and thin, cut in the end, dented about the edges, with reddiſh points ſeeming prickly like a thiſtle, but are not; from the middle whereof riſeth up a round and ſhorter ſtalk, than that of the wilder ſort, ſet with like leaves but leſſer, and at the top one head of the bigneſs of a reaſonable Muſk-melon, or Pome-citron, of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh green before it be ripe, &amp; more <hi>yellowiſh</hi> being thorow-ripe, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were ſcaly like an Artichoke at the firſt view, but more like to a Cone of the Pine-tree, which we call a Pine-Apple for the form, yet the out-ſide hath no hardneſs at all therein, but may be cut or pared like unto Mellow Peach and are ſo ſweet in ſcent, that they may be ſmelled afar off, and of a pleaſant ſweet taſt and ſubſtance, taſting as if Wine, Roſewater, and Sugar were mixed together, and having no ſeed at all in it, whereby it may be increaſed; but, as ſome ſay, it hath whitiſh ſeed like a <hi>Musk-melon,</hi> but leſſer and longer; this fruit doth bear a buſh of leaves at the top, and ſome ſmall heads on ſmall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches underneath it, which being taken from it and planted half way deep in the ground, will take root and bear fruit the next year, which is the onely way of propagating thereof.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Braſile,</hi> it is ſaid they have ſundry ſorts hereof, one they <hi>call Jaama,</hi> which is longer and pleaſanter than any other, and of a <hi>yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Another they <hi>call Benjama</hi> being whiter within, and of a Wawmiſh taſt, with the Luſciouſneſs; a third they <hi>call Jajagna,</hi> white alſo within but taſting like ſweet Wine with a little tartneſs; the root is great with many ſtrings thereat, but periſheth with the ſtalk after the fruit is ripe; it was firſt brought from <hi>Sancta Cruce,</hi> in <hi>Braſil,</hi> where it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally groweth, into both <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> being not natural to either of them, but is onely manured there, and now is grown there plentiful; They of <hi>Braſile call</hi> it <hi>Nana,</hi> others <hi>Anana;</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugalls call</hi> it <hi>Pinus</hi> from the likeneſs, and ſo do moſt Countries following that name. The cheifeſt time of their ripeneſs is in the Spring, when they are ſweeteſt.</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>Pina,</hi> ſurpaſſeth all other fruits in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and wholſomeneſs, ſo that many eat them abundantly, but a ſurfeit with them is dangerous, as it is with the beſt Meats, drinks or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54089:84"/> fruits whatſoever; The Phyſitians there forbid it their Patients leſt, it ſhould breed inflamations. Some wonders are reported hereof, which I never had experience of, neither do intend to go thither to diſprove them. As namely, That if one of theſe fruits be cut through the middle with a knife, and they joyned together again, the peices will joyn and ſtick ſo faſt together, as if they had not been cut aſunder at all; Another property it hath, that if one cut the fruit with a knife; and leave the knife ſticking therein untill the next day, ſo much of the blade thereof as ſtuck within the fruit will be wholy conſumed and waſted, or as it were eaten away; the knife alſo that did cut one of them, if it be not forthwith clean wiped, but let alone unwiped, will ſeem as if it had been eaten in with <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi>

Among the leaves come forth here and there, the flowers, which are like Bell-flowers, broad at the brims, and ſmaller at the bottom, being one whole leaf, divided at the top into five parts: of an orient red Crimſon colour naturally, but much paler with us, and many veins running through it, with divers threds in the middle; and ſtanding in a browniſh hollow cup, or long hard husk: the fruit is great and round, with a hard, ſmooth, browniſh, red rind; not very thick, but yellowiſh on the inſide: and a Crown at the top, ſtored plentifully with a moſt cleer Liquor or juice like Wine; either ſweet or ſower, or between both; full of ſeeds incloſed in skins and the liquor among them: Sometimes this breaketh the rind as it groweth, which will cauſe it to rot very ſoon.</hi>

                  <p>Deſcript.] 1. <hi>The greater Pomcitron tree,</hi> Malus Citria major. <hi>The greater Citron tree groweth not very high in ſome places, but with a ſhort crooked body, but in others not much lower than the Lemon tree, ſpreading
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54089:88"/> ſundry great long Armes, and branches; ſet with long and ſharp thorns, and fair large and broad freſh green leaves, a little dented about the edges, with a ſhew of almoſt inviſible holes in them, but leſs than the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range leaves have; of a very ſweet ſcent, the flowers green at the leaves, all along the branches, being ſomewhat longer than thoſe of the Orange; made of five thick whitiſh purple or bluſh leaves, with ſome threads in the middle, after which followeth fruit all the year, being ſeldome ſeen without ripe fruit, and half-ripe, and ſmall young and green, and bloſſoms all at once. This kind beareth great and large fruit, ſome as great as a Musk-melon, yet others leſſer, but all of them with a rugged, bunched-out and uneven yellow bark; thicker than in any of the other ſorts, and with ſmall ſtore of ſowr juice in the middle, and ſomewhat great, pale whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh or yellow ſeed, with a bitter kernell lying in it: the ſmell of this fruit is very ſtrong, and very comfortable to the ſenſes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcript.] 2. Limonera acida, <hi>ſowr Limeroons. This is very like the laſt, but ſomewhat bigger; more yellow-rinded, and ſomewhat rugged; the juice whereof is more ſowr than it, yet leſſer than of a Lemon.</hi>

This Rubarb is ſo gentle a medecine, that it may be given to all Conſtitutions, whether they be Children or Women with Child, and that ſafely at all times of the year; the whey of Milk but eſpeceially of Goats Milk, is the beſt and moſt proper liquor wherein it is to be ſteeped and taken, or elſe in White-wine, whereby it worketh more effectually; in opening Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and purging the Stomack and Liver from Choler and Flegm; a little <hi>Indian</hi> Spikenard uſed therewith is the beſt Correcter thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Kinds and Names.]</hi> THere was formerly but one kind of Roſemary known to us, which was the ordinary Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary; but now we have diſcovered ſeveral ſorts, which ſhall follow with their Names, before their Deſcriptions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> 1. Ordinary Roſemary. It is called in Latine <hi>Libanotis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronaria, ſive Roſmarinum vulgare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is no natural Engliſh plant, yet in divers Gardens in this Land, where it hath ſtood long, aſwel as in its naturall Soil; it groweth in time to a great height, with a great and Woody ſtem of a cloſe firm ſubſtance and whitiſh within branching forth into many Arms, &amp; from them again into many other ſmaller branches, at the joints whereof are ſet at ſeveral diſtances, many long and very narrow leaves, green a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and greyiſh underneath; and with all, along the ſtalks towards the tops, divers ſmall gapeing flowers, of a pale, bleak, blewiſh colour, ſtanding in whitiſh huſks; the ſeed is ſmall and reddiſh, but ſeldom doth any that is ſown in our Country endure the firſt Winter without Extraordinary care, and therefore is uſually increaſed by ſlipping. The whole plant hath an Aromatical ſmell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> 2. Gilded Roſemary. <hi>Roſmarinum ſtriatum ſive Aureum,</hi> is the Latine appellation. This differeth not from the former in any thing, but in the leaves, which are edged, or ſtriped, or pointed with with a fair Gold yellow colour, which ſo continueth all the year, yet freſher in Summer than Winter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> 3. Broad-leafed Roſemary, called in Latine <hi>Roſmarinum Latifolium.</hi> This groweth like the former, but not ſo great in our Country nor with ſuch Woody branches, and is more tender to keep; the leaves are larger, and of a more ſhining deep green colour on the upper ſide, and little or nothing whitiſh underneath, more thinly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo or ſparſedly ſet on the ſtalks; the flowers differ nor from the former kinds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> 4. Double flowred-Roſemary. <hi>Roſmarinum flore duplici.</hi> This differs from the former, in this, that it hath ſtronger ſtalks while it is young, then the laſt, or not ſo eaſie to break; fairer alſo, and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leaves then the firſt, and the flowers are double like thoſe of the Larkes-heel, or Larks-ſpur.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> 5. Whild-ſweet Sileſia Roſemary, or <hi>Mathiolus</hi> his Wild <hi>Bohemian</hi> Roſemary. <hi>Roſmarinum ſylveſtre Bohemicum Mathioli, ſive Laedum Sileſiacum Cluſii.</hi> This riſeth with Woody aſh-coloured bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, two foot high or more, which ſhoot forth other branches of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh colour covered with a browniſh-yellow hoarineſs, on which are ſet many narrow, long, green leaves, like unto thoſe of Roſemary, but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54089:96"/> covered with the like hoarineſs as the ſtalks are, eſpecially in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural place, but not ſo much being tranſplanted, &amp; folding their ſides ſo cloſe together that they ſeem nothing but ribs or ſtalks, of an excellent pleaſant and ſweet ſmell; at the ends of the branches grow certain browniſh and ſcaly leaves, out of which ſpreadeth a tuft of many flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, conſiſting of five white leaves a peece, with ten white chines or threeds in the middle, and in ſome plants with ſix leaves, and twelve threds or Chives, after which follow five long ſquare heads, ſpotted with ſilver-like white ſpots, while they are green; but grow browniſh, when they are ripe, and turn down their tops, opening their husks at the ſtalks, leaſt the ſeed which is as ſmall as duſt ſhould fall out; the Root is Woody with ſhort ſprigs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> 6. Unſavory Wild Roſemary, <hi>Roſmarinum ſylveſtre,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This doth nearly reſemble Roſemary, but is not ſweet like them: It groweth above a foot high, having divers reddiſh branches which divide themſelves into others, ſmaller, of a whitiſh colour, ſet confuſedly with long and narrow leaves, green on the upperſide and hoary underneath, like thoſe of the Dwarffe-Willow, of no pleaſant ſcent at all, but of an Aſtringent taſte; At the tops of the branches, ſtand divers heads, compoſed of many ſhort ſcales, out of which ſhoot forth ſundry flowers, ſtanding on long foot-ſtalks, made of five leaves a peece, of a fine pale reddiſh or fleſh colour, after which riſe ſhort five-ſquare heads, with blunt points containing ſmall pale coloured ſeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſcript.]</hi> 7. Our Wild Roſemary. <hi>Roſmarinum ſylveſtre minus, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtras.</hi> This Wild North Country Roſemary, groweth not ſo high, with ſmaller leaves; nothing ſo great and long as Roſemary leaves, but thicker, and ſhorter; of a dark green ſhining colour above, and ſomewhat yellowiſh, green underneath, ſet very ſparſedly on very ſlender and pliant, blackiſh, green twigs, at the tops whereof grow the flowers not out of ſcaly heads as in the former, of a reddiſh colour: the whole plant hath very little ſcent, if any at all, that can be perceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Place and Time.]</hi> The Ordinary Roſemary groweth in <hi>Spain,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly neer the Sea-ſide, on Commons as Heath doth with us; the ſcent whereof is many times ſmelt, by thoſe that paſſe by in Ships, very many leagues off from the Land; in <hi>Provence</hi> alſo of <hi>France,</hi> and ſundry other thoſe hot Countries, but will not abide (unleſs kept in Stows) the Winter, in divers places of <hi>Germany, Denmark, Swedland</hi> and thoſe other Northerly Regions. The fifth in <hi>Sileſia, Bohemia,</hi> and the parts thereabouts. The ſixt in the ſame places with the fifth. The laſt in divers places in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Yorke-ſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt flowereth in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> with us, and ſometimes in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the others not until <hi>Auguſt;</hi> But at Chriſtmas laſt, at <hi>Hedſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wharffe</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> there was Roſemary with very freſh bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes.</p>

                  <p>It riſeth up with a thick round ſtalk about two foot high, whereon do grow thick fat fleſhy green leaves, nothing ſo large as the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian kinds, neither for breadth nor length, ſomewhat round-poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo, and nothing dented about the edges: the ſtalk brancheth forth and beareth at the tops divers flowers, ſet in green huſks, ſcarce ſtanding above the brims of the huſks round-pointed alſo, and of a greeniſh yellow colour; after which followeth the ſeeds contained in great heads; The root is woody byt periſheth in winter, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally riſeth of the ſeed that is ſuffered to ſhed it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Place and Time.]</hi> This (as is ſuppoſed) was firſt brought from <hi>Brazile,</hi> it giveth ripe ſeed in our Countrey here earlier than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indian ſorts.

                     <hi>Government and Vertues.]</hi> Tobacco is a Plant of <hi>Saturn, Culpeppers</hi> deity; of a ſtupifying quality: it is held to be available to expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate tough phlegm out of the ſtomach cheſt and lungs; the juice thereof made into a Syrup,<note place="margin">Phlegm, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Cheſt, Lungs, worms,</note> or the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54089:113"/> diſtilled water of the herb drank with Sugar; The ſame alſo helps to expell worms in the ſtomach and belly, as alſo to apply a leaf to the belly, and to eaſe the pains in the head or Meagrim,<note place="margin">Pains in the head, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, Stone, Gravel, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and griping pains in the bowels; It is alſo profitable for thoſe that are troubled with the ſtone in the kidneys, to eaſe pains, and, by provoking Urine, to expell gravel and the ſtone ingendred therein; and hath been found very effectual to ſuppreſs the malignity and windy vapours which cauſe the ſtrangling of the mother; The ſeed hereof is much more effectual to eaſe the pains of the teeth, than Henbane-ſeed, and the aſhes of the burnt herb to cleanſe the gums and teeth, and make them white; The herb bruiſed and applyed to the place of the Kings-Evil, is a ſpeedy rememdy as is ſaid. It is alſo ſaid to be effectual to cure the Dropſie,<note place="margin">Kings-Evil, Dropſie.</note> by taking four or five ounces of the juice thereof faſting; which will ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purge the body both upwards and downwards, (And too ſtrongly too, unleſs it be a well ſteeled body indeed.) The diſtilled water is often given with ſome ſugar before the fit of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, to leſſen the fits and alter them, and to take them quite away in three or four times uſing; if the diſtilled faces of the herb having been bruiſed before the diſtillation, and not diſtilled dry, be ſet in hot dung to digeſt for fourteen days, and afterwards hung up in a bag in a Cellar, the liquor that diſtilleth therefrom is ſingular good to uſe for Cramps, Aches, the Gout and Sciatica, and to heal Itches,<note place="margin">Cramps, aches, Gouts, Sciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Scabs, Cankers, Lice, Green wounds, Old Sores.</note> Scabs, and running Ulcers, and foul Sores whatſoever; The juice is good for all the ſaid griefs, and likewiſe to kill lice in childrens heads. The herb bruiſed and applyed to any green wound doth ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heal the ſame, the juice put into old ſores doth heal the ſame. A good ſalve thereof may be made in this manner; Take of the green herb three or four handfulls, bruiſe it, and put it into a quart of good oyl-olive, boyl them on a gentle fire, till the herb grow dry and the oyl will bubble no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, adding thereto, wax Rozen and ſheeps-tallow, or Deers ſuet, of each a quarter of a pound, of Turpentine two ounces, which being melted put it up for your uſe: Some will add to it the powder of round Birthworth, and white Frankincenſe, each half an ounce, which is to be put in when it is nigh cold and well ſtirred together; This Salve likewiſe will help Impoſthumes, hard tumors, and other Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by by Bblows or Falls.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54089:115"/> white, and ſtand in crooked ſpiky heads, bowing like a Scorpions tail, as the other, but the ſeed being ſmaller standing ſingly, or but two together; the roots are ſmall and periſh in like manner.</hi>

                  <p>Deſcript.] 1. <hi>The manured Vine,</hi> Vitis vinifera. <hi>This where it hath ſtood long groweth to have a great ſtem ſpreading without end or meaſure, if it be ſuffered; many ſlender weak branches that muſt be propped up from falling down; the young being red, and the old of a dark colour, with a pyth in the midſt, at the ſundry ioynts whereof grow ſeveral large broad green leaves, cut into five diviſions, and dented alſo about the edges: at the joynts likewiſe againſt the leaves come forth long twining Tendrels, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or winding about whatſoever it can take hold of; at the bottom of the leaves come forth cluſters of ſmall greeniſh yellow flowers, and after them berries ſet thick together in branches of ſeveral forms, of greatneſs, colour, and taſte, in ſome the cluſters are cloſe and others more open, and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, others more round, tending to a ſquare; ſome likewiſe are very ſmall, as the Curran-grape, others great, and ſome in a mean, between both: ſome are white, others black, or blewiſh, or red, or parti-coloured;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54089:116"/> and for taſtes they are very variable, ſome ſweet according to the ſeveral Climates they grow in; and ſowr, or harſh, or mixt, more or leſs pleaſant one than another; within which there are uſually one two or three kernels. They that keep their Vines in the beſt manner, do keep them low, and cut them often, whereby they grow the better and take up leſs room; bringing their grapes both fairer and ſweeter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcript.] 2. <hi>The Parſly-Vine or Grape with thin-cut leaves,</hi> Vitis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciniatis foliis. <hi>This alſo groweth as other Vines do, the difference chiefly conſiſting in the leaves, which are very much inciſed, or cut into many parts even almost to the middle; and dented: the grapes which are white and great are like the white muſcadine-grape, and of as good a relliſh; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring great bunches, and ripening with the middle ſort of grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcript.] 3. <hi>The wild Vine of Europe,</hi> Labruſca ſive Vitis ſylveſtris Europaea. <hi>The wild Vine, in regard it is natural and therefore neglected, lyeth for the moſt part on the ground, and therefore is leſs fruitful, unleſs it meet with ſome hedge or tree whereon it may climb, and then ſpreadeth as the manured, being both in branches leaves and tendrels, like unto the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured Vine; as alſo in bloſſomes, but beareth either little or no fruit, or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cometh to ripeneſs; and what it doth is ſmall and black, and no way comparable to any of the manured Vines, being rather binding and ſowr than ſweet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcript.] 4. <hi>The wild Vine of Virginia,</hi> Vitis ſylveſtris Virginiana. <hi>This one ſort of the Vines of Virginia like all other wild ſorts runneth on the ground, and taketh hold of whatſoever it meeteth with, being in all things like the former wild ſorts, but that the grapes are ſmall and white, and with little ſap or juice in them, and the kernels twice as big as others. There is another ſort that hath bigger blew grapes and ſowr in taſte: a third they call the Fox-grape, and hath a more rugged bark, a very broad leaf, without any diviſion almoſt, but dented, and the grape is white, but ſmelleth and taſteth like unto a Fox.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcript.] 5. <hi>The wild Vine of</hi> Canada. <hi>This groweth like unto the other wild Vines of thoſe parts, with ſlender reddiſh branches, climbing where it can get thereon; but the leaves on them being little more than half ſo large as the manured Vine, hath only three partitions in every leaf; but each cut-in deep, even to the long ſmooth ſtalk whereon they stand, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſeem as three leaves, which are of a dark green colour, and ſomewhat thick alſo; the fruit is like the other wild ſorts, having more skin and kernel, than ſubſtance or juice.</hi>

                     <p>The juice of the grape is of two ſorts. That is made of unripe grapes, which is called varjuice, or of the ripe grapes called wine. The var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice is a fine tart liquor, fit to be uſed in broths, meats or ſawces, to ſharpen the ſtomach, to get an Appetite, and to refreſh and quicken fainting ſpirits; of this juice is made a Syrrup of eſpecial uſe in the ſame cauſes: the wine is of ſo many ſundry ſorts, as not only the grapes but the ſundry Climates and Soyls wherein they grow are. The weak wines are very Rhumatick, and cleanſe much; the ſtrong wines are very heady, and inflame the bloud very much; thoſe of a middle temper are moſt proper for our bodies, and moſt wholſome for our health, and moſt uſeful in phyſick; both to boyl in drinks, and to ſerve as the <hi>vehiculum,</hi> to extract the virtues of whatſoever ſhall be ſteeped in it; And is diſtributed into many parts, for of it is made both <hi>Sapa</hi> and <hi>defrutum,</hi> in Engliſh Cuite that is to ſay, boyled wine, and both made of <hi>muſtum,</hi> new wine; the later boyled to the half, the former to the third part. Then there is <hi>Acetum</hi> vinegar, that is, ſowr wine, which is made by ſetting it in the Sun, which exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the purer ſpirits and the heat, cauſeth the other to grow acide, and is of great uſe both in health and ſickneſs, both in meat and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sapa</hi> and <hi>defrutum</hi> differing but only in the manner of boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they may be both comprehended under Cuite. It helpeth the cough and ſhortneſs of breath,<note place="margin">Cough, Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of breath, Phlegm, Cheſt, Lungs.</note> and to expectorate tough phlegm from the Cheſt and Lungs. It alſo eaſily paſſeth through the belly and maketh it ſoluble.</p>
                     <p>Vinegar contrariwiſe is cooling and drying as the Cuite is, heating and moiſtning, and therefore ſerveth to correct the heat in Feavers, and to reſiſt putrefaction; it cutteth tough phlegm that is hard baked, and not eaſily ſpit up and brought forth; It is very ſharp and penetrating, and very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſcabs, Itches, tetters, ringworms,<note place="margin">Tough phlegm, Scabs, Itches, Tetters, Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms.</note> and fretting and creeping Ulcers, to correct their malignity, and extirpate their corroding quality; but is offenſive to the ſinews, by its piercing and drying quality cauſeth them to ſhrink, but the diſtilled Vinegar is of a more fiery and penetrating quality, which it gaineth by the diſtillation thereof; the manner and order in this being quite different from the diſtilling of wine, wherein the pureſt and ſtrongeſt ſpirits do firſt riſe and come forth; when as in vinegar almoſt two third parts are taken from it, which are the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt before the laſt and ſtrongeſt riſeth; but not the laſt, which is the <hi>Empireuma,</hi> and ſerveth even as the vinegar it ſelf doth, but with more

                  <p>I Would willingly have omitted this common Wormwood and ſaid nothing of it, but that <hi>Culpepper</hi> hath ſo ridiculouſly Romanced upon it; and it remains ſtill under colour of truth.</p>
                  <p>Common Wormwood called <hi>Abſynthium vulgare,</hi> is well known to have many whitiſh green leaves, ſomewhat more hoary underneath, much divided or cut into parts, from among which riſe up divers hard and woody hoary ſtalks two or three foot high, beſet with like leaves as grow below, but ſmaller; divided at the tops into ſmaller branches; whereon grow many ſmall yellow buttons with pale yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low flowers in them, wherein afterwards is contained ſmall ſeed: the root is hard and woody with many ſtrings thereat, the ſtalks hereof dye down every year, but the root holdeth a tuft of green leaves, all the winter ſhooting forth new again, which are of a ſtrong ſcent, but not unpleaſant; and of a very bitter taſte. The <hi>Seriphium</hi> or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormwood is much weaker but of a pleaſant bitterneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Place and Time.]</hi> It is plentifully found in moſt places in England, and flowers about <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Government and Virtues.]</hi> All the ſorts of Wormwoods are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Plants. It is of a heating binding property, and is ſaid to purge Choler that cleaveth to the ſtomach or belly. It is ſaid alſo to provoke Urine, help Surfets,<note place="margin">Choler, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, Surfeits, pains in the ſtomach, Yellow Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</note> and eaſe pains in the ſtomach.

Take ſaith he of the flowers of Roſemary, Wormwood, and Blackthorn each a like quantity, of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron half that quantity, all which being boyled in Rheniſh wine, let it be given after the body is prepared by purging, a ſmall draught thereof taken a few days together, bringeth down womens Courſes;<note place="margin">Womens Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Heart, Liver.</note> being taken with vinegar it helpeth thoſe that are almoſt ſtrangled by eating Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms. It helpeth the pains of the heart and Liver, being beaten and mixed with <hi>Ceratum Cyprinum,</hi> and applyed, as alſo applyed to the ſtomach with Roſewater, it giveth much comfort to thoſe that have layn long ſick. It helpeth thoſe that are troubled with the ſwelling and hardneſs of the ſpleen, or thoſe that have a hot ſharp water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between the ſkin and the fleſh. It is often uſed both inwardly and outwardly for the worms, the ſeed thereof helpeth the Bloody flux,<note place="margin">Spleen, Worms, Bloody-flux.</note> and all other flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54089:121"/> vinegar wherein wormwood hath been boyled is good for a ſtinking breath that cometh from the gums or teeth, or corruption of the Stomach.

                  <p>Thus I am ſure I have ſet down all the true virtues of wormwood, and it may be ſome more than will bear the Teſt when they are tryed: if I ſhould have written all that Authors ſay of wormwood, I ſhould have taken up a great deal of room, ſtuff'd full of falſities; for, beſides <hi>Culpeppers</hi> idle Romancing upon it, others have mightily commended it for dimneſs of ſight, and to clear the eyes; if they had ſaid it is good to cauſe dimneſs of ſight and put out the eyes, they had been nearer the truth. Another ſtory they have of it, that it preſerves cloaths from moths and worms, and driveth away Gnats, Fleas, and ſuch noiſome Inſects if the ſkin be anoynted with the juice or oyl there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is utterly falſe as I have had the experience upon my ſelf; for being troubled, and gnats lodging in the countrey near the Sea-ſide, where gnats are very troubleſome in the night, to prevent which, as I then believed, I cauſed my chamber to be rubbed all over, and both walls and windows, with wormwood, and anointed my ſelf with the juice of it all over, thinking to have a quiet night, but was worſe infeſted with fleas and Gnats than ever before; ſo that I was forced to leave my Chamber and walk all night. Theſe are the true virtues of wormwood.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Bitumen</hi> or dry Pitch which the dead Sea in <hi>Judaea</hi> caſteth up at certain times in the year, is ſet down by <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> to be of a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning purple-colour, but that which is black is adulterate. And <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Aſphaltum</hi> or <hi>Bitumen</hi> of the Shops in <hi>Italy</hi> (and ſo with us) is a mixture, and not the true thing. The true <hi>Bitumen</hi> is that of the Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> and thoſe Cities mentioned in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which were deſtroyed by fire and Brimſtone from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Many Writers diverſly ſet down the dimenſions, or length thereof; eſpecially <hi>Pliny</hi> and his followers: But the true deſcription thereof as it was exactly ſurveyed by one of our Countreymen who writes his own experience, and not the relations of thoſe who never ſaw the place, take it in his own words.</p>
                     <p>This Lake is called <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites:</hi> it yieldeth a kind of ſlime, named <hi>Bitumen</hi> or <hi>Aſphaltum,</hi> which bituminous ſavour no living thing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54089:122"/> can endure. And now, <hi>Mare mortuum; Mare,</hi> becauſe it is ſalt; and <hi>Mortuum,</hi> becauſe it is dead, for that no living thing breeds therein, and more properly for this cauſe, called the dead-Sea, becauſe of it ſelf it is unmoveable, ſuch is the Leproſie and ſtability of the water: it is alſo called ſo, becauſe if a Bird fly over it, ſhe preſently falleth down dead. It ſmoaketh continually from whence proceed filthy vapours, which deform the fields lying about for certain miles, as it were blaſted, ſcorched, and made utterly barren; This ſmoak <hi>I</hi> take onely to be but the exhalation of <hi>Jordan,</hi> for this River falling into it and there ending his courſe, the two contrary natures cannot agree; the one being a filthy puddle, and the other a pure water.</p>
                     <p>This Lake is eighty miles in length, and ſix in breadth, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with the Rocks of <hi>Arabia Petraea</hi> on the South, on the North with the Sandy hills of the wilderneſs of <hi>Judaea,</hi> on the Weſt with the ſteepy mountains of <hi>Arabia deſerta,</hi> and on the Eaſt with the Plains of <hi>Jericho.</hi> How cometh it to paſs therefore that the freſh run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning floud of <hi>Jordan</hi> falling evermore into this bounded Sea, that the Lake it ſelf never diminiſheth nor increaſeth, but alwayes ſtandeth at one fulneſs, neither hath it any iſſuing forth, nor reboundeth back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on the Planes of <hi>Jericho,</hi> which is one of the greateſt wonders in the world? Wherefore (as I have ſaid) it muſt needs exhale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the clouds, or elſe run down into hell: For if it ran under the Rocks, and ſo burſt out in the Deſarts, it would ſoon be known; but in all the bounds of <hi>Arabia deſerta</hi> which between this Lake and the Red-Sea, extend to three hundred miles, there is no ſuch matter as Brook or Strand, much leſs a River, neither hath it any Intercourſe with the Ocean. It breedeth nor reſerveth no kind of fiſhes, and if by the ſwelling of <hi>Jordan</hi> any fiſhes fall into it, they immediately die. And although <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith that in his time, there were apples grew upon the banks thereof, like unto the colour of gold, and within were rotten, and would conſume to powder, if touched; yet I affirm now the contrary, for there is not ſuch a thing (whatſoever hath been in his days) as either trees or buſhes grow near to <hi>Sodom</hi> by many miles; Such is the conſummation of that peſtiferous Gulf; Divers Authours have reported that nothing will ſink into it of any reaſonable weight, as dead men, or Carkaſſes of Beaſts. But by experience I affirm the contrary, for it beareth nothing above at all; yea not the weight of a feather: the water it ſelf is of a blackiſh colour, and at ſome times in the year there are terrible ſhapes and ſhows of Terrour in it, as I was informed at <hi>Jericho,</hi> which is the neareſt Town that bordereth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and that is fifteen miles diſtance.

            </p>
            <p>If you ſhall imagine that the ſkul of any Patient is broken, not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the membrane of the brain, which you ſhall gather either by ſenſe or reaſon, the firſt is found out either by the finger of Probe, by both which you will feel it rugged; only have a care that the Sutures in the head do not deceive you. The rational ſigns are taken diverſly, as if he fell from on high, the perſon ſtrong, or the weapon great that cauſed the wound, its probable the ſkul is broken if they bleed at noſe ears or mouth, if they ſwoon or vomit, if he often touch the wound, if he raves or falter in his ſpeech, be dull, weak of judgment and underſtanding, all theſe are ſigns of a broken ſkul; If a Feaver happen to the Patient before the thirteenth day in Winter, and ſeventh in Summer, it will go ill with him. If the ſkul be blackiſh, moſt commonly deadly; but if the fleſh be red the membran called <hi>dura mater</hi> be of its right colour, and he move well his neck and jaws, there is hope of his Recovery. If the Patient be old, if the fracture be upon the fore part of the head called <hi>Sinciput,</hi> or the Temples or Sutures, then the caſe is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Then the firſt thing you are to do (having prepared your Patients body by blood-letting, Suppoſiters glyſters and gentle Purges, as you ſhal ſee cauſe and your judgment ſhall direct you) is to ſhave the head
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54089:135"/> an Inciſion being made after the maner of a croſs, or letter X, take up all to the ſkul either with a <hi>Chiſel</hi> or your fingers, but make not your Inciſion on the Temporal muſcles, that done keep it open with pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, armed with the aſtringent powders, then roll it up, the next day if a flux of blood be not feared, or upon the ſkul, about the fourth day after wounding, if ill ſymptoms hinder not, then upon the ſeventh or ninth; ſome think it may be prolonged till the fourteenth day, but the ſooner the better. The Inſtruments for this purpoſe firſt are Raſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, the next is the Trepan or Traſin, in the uſe of which when you are come to the ſecond table take out the Pin, and moiſten the Trafine with oyl and cold water, then wipe away the blood, to ſee if it be cut equal; when it begins to ſhake lift it up with a levatory, then ſmooth it with a <hi>Scalper,</hi> the Gimlet or <hi>Terebra</hi> ſerves to raiſe the depreſſed part, firſt making way in the ſkul with the pin of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, after ſcrew it in and draw up the depreſſion; the Head-ſawe is uſed either to give vent in fractures, or to take off ſome ragged peece of the ſkul: While you are uſing the Trafine you are to ſtop the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ear cloſe with cottons, having a good fire by you all the while, his head being held firmly. After you have done your work apply a peece of Sarſenet or Taffety dipped in honey of Roſes, or oyl of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; Spirit of wine, conveying it betwixt the membrane called <hi>dura mater</hi> and the ſkul; then fill the whole wound with <hi>Arceus</hi> his Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe with this medicine, <hi>Take one ounce of Turpentine waſh'd in Sage or Betony-water, one ounce and half of oyl of Roſes, two ounces of the oyl of yolks of eggs, Gum-elemy and Mastich, (diſſolved over a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fire in the aforeſaid oyls) of each half an ounce, Saffron in powder one ſcruple, the yolks of two eggs, make of them an oyntment, upon them apply</hi> Emplaſt. de Janua Gratia Dei, <hi>or the Betony-plaiſter, you may uſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſes and Spirit of wine till the ſeventh day, after dreſſing anoynt the parts adjoyning with oyl of Roſes, and in the neck where the veins of the throat are; whereby pain is aſſwaged and heat of bloud mitigated; if there happen flux of bloud in applying the Trafin, uſe ſome of the aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent powders beforementioned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you have a ſimple fracture called a fiſſure, if it be apparent it is either to or through the ſecond table, which are to be enlarged or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened as far as they will go with a Raſpatory, leaving a way for the matter and bloud in the depending part. That which is not apparent if you cannot find it by the Patients holding his breath or a multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſs, apply Ink to the reſpective part; if it leave any print, the next day being made clean, then, follow it as far as it goes with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovenamed Inſtrument, afterwards dreſs it as after Trafining.</p>
            <p>If you meet with a fracture in the ſkul called <hi>Sedes</hi> or ſeat, which is when the weapon ſo falls upon the ſkul that the fracture retaining the print thereof, is neither ſtretched forth nor contracted thereby; if
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54089:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> this paſs through both the tables and the membrans not hurt by any ſplinter, the matter may be made to be diſcharged dreſſing it as before will ſuffice But if the membran called <hi>dura mater,</hi> be offended or the paſſage be too narrow to diſcharge the matter, remove what offends and enlarge the other with the Raſpatory.</p>
            <p>For a Contuſion or Bruiſe on the ſkul, if it ſhall be ſo great that the ſkin be ſeparated from the ſkul, you ſhall make Inciſion whereby the bloud may be emptied, and ſo by depreſſing of the part and drying medicines with <hi>Emplaſtrum</hi> Opodoldock may be perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>The Fracture called depreſſion hath the ſhivers either quite ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or cleaving to the reſt or both, if the laſt happen remove the looſe ſhivers, and with a levatory raiſe the reſt; after dreſs it with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſes and Spirit of wine, and if the levatory fail you, uſe the Trafine as near the fracture as you can.</p>
            <p>When you ſhall happen to ſee the ſkul pulled upward leaving a cavity beneath like a vault, if it go only to the ſecond table, ſmooth the ſkul, and cure the wound as before according to art; if it paſs through the ſecond table, open the ſkul with the Trafine in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending part, then cure it according to art.</p>
            <p>When the part of the ſkul wounded is altogether ſeparated from the whole which is double, Firſt, when the firſt table is parted from the ſecond, and cleaves to the <hi>Maſculous</hi> ſkin, then take it away and cure the wound, either by medicines that cloſe the lips of the wounds and bring them to perfect union, ſuch as before mentioned; or the powders of the roots of Lung-wort, <hi>Tormentil Cinquefoyl,</hi> leavs of <hi>hounds tongue, Karrow, Vervin, Mouſe-ear, Sanicle, Scabious, Myrrhe, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Aloes,</hi> &amp;c. Or ſuch medicines which procure the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fleſh wanting in any wound, ſuch as <hi>Frankincenſe, Turpentine, Pitch, Aloes, myrrhe, Burnt Lead, Cerus,</hi> which may be moſt fit; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you muſt uſe no unctuous or oily medicines to the bones. The ſecond is when a portion of the whole ſkul is divided, ſo that the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra mater</hi> is ſeen, this is to be put in its proper place and there kept; by bringing the brims of the wound together, with as many ſtrong and deep ſtitches as ſuffice; firſt waſhing the wound well with wine, or Spirit of wine. Sometimes the ſkul is broken in the part near or oppoſite to that which received the blow; as if the right ſide be ſtruck the left is cloven; if it be nigh the wound, the ſides of the wound near the fracture will not cicatrize, although the other doth: there will ſlow a thin wateriſh matter more than the wound can ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; rhe fleſh near to the part is ſpongy, you may find the ſkin ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the ſkul with your Probe, and you will perceive ſome ſwelling above the fracture: if it be oppoſite, it is either in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite part, or when the ſecond table being broken the other is whole. Theſe are hard to find, but by conjecture or theſe ſigns. If the Patient vomit choler, have a Feaver, with other ſymptoms belonging to a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54089:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Patient will put his hands to it often, if there appear a Swelling there is aſſuredly a fracture, if no ſwelling appear in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite part ſhave it and apply this; <hi>viz. Take Ship-puchand wax, of each three ounces, one ounce of Turpentine, Maſtick and Powder of Orrice-root of each two drams, make a Plaiſter of them, ſpread it upon leather, and being applyed let it lie twenty four hours; if after you have taken it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the fleſh appear in any place more moiſt ſoft and ſwelled then the reſt, its probable the fracture is there. In theſe fractures the skul muſt be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Trafine, and cured according to art; if ſuch Patients die, the Chirurgeon is not to be blamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſkul being broken without a wound if in children, having ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the head, apply oyl of Roſes, the white of an egg, and a little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar; apply it cold in Summer, but warm in winter, with a cloath four double; let it lie for twenty four hours, afterwards till the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day apply this. <hi>Take of red Roſes and Myrtle berries of each two ounces, Barley and Bean-flower of each one ounce, Wormwood and Bettony of each half an ounce, two drams of Commin-ſeeds powdered, Boyl them all in a pinte of Red-wine to the thickneſs of a Pultis according to art, then add oyl of Roſes and Oyl of Camomile, of each one ounce, and two ounces of honey being mixt, it is to be applyed morning and evening; or Paracelſus plaiſter hath been applyed with good ſucceſs; but from the eleventh to the twentieth day apply this following plaiſter.

            <p>Wounds in the noſe if in the ſoft part only, may be cured by dry ſtitch as before, obſerving the ſame method; if in the hard part it is either the bone, or griſtle otherwiſe called Cartilage; if in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, broken reſtore it, by putting up ſome Inſtrument or fit ſtick wrapt about with a ſoft linnen rag, then with Pledgets dipt in this aſtringent medicine made of the white of an egg.

            <p>Wounds of the lips are to be cured as other common wounds, if they pierce not through, but if they do, they are to be cured as in the hair lip, which is done by piercing through the lips of the wound with a needle or two if occaſion be, putting a thin piece of lead on both ſides; Laſtly, ſnip off the ends of the needle and caſt the ſilk about the ends thereof, as Taylors do when they faſten them to the ſkirt or ſleeves, this muſt be done in the middle, but at the ends an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtitch will ſerve; eſpecially in children: the wound is to be dreſſed with <hi>Arceus</hi> his Linement; if the inward part of the lips be wounded, as happens by falls and the like, then uſe within, Honey of Roſes, Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of dryed Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

In other places where you may uſe rowling, you muſt rowl below the wound upward, and when you come to the wound rowl three or four times about: but if you cannot make uſe of rolling the part, then if you can come at the mouth of the veſſel with your finger or thumb, preſs it ſo long till the bloud ſhall be ſo thick as a clot about it, and ſo ſtop its paſſage; or uſe this powder following, <hi>Take two drams of Frankincenſe, Aloes, Dragons bloud, Cobwebs, Maſtich, Sarcocol. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mber, of each one dram, and make them into a fine powder; if this prevail not, notnigh a noble part, ſome add ſublimate and auripigmentum, of each half a dram, to two drams of

            <p>Wounds of the breaſt either pierce into the cavity and ſo wound ſome of the parts within the ſame, as the heart, lungs, midriff, and the veſſels, as the <hi>vena cava,</hi> i. e. the hollow vein, and the aſcending Arterie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or not: if they pierce which is known if you hold a Candle to the part ſtopping the Patients mouth and noſe, his breath will come forth with a noiſe and the flame of Candle will be moved; as in a ſmall wind, and ſometimes quite blown out: and if other parts be wounded in piercing, they are known by their proper ſigns; as if there guſh out much bloud, there follow a general trembling over the whole body, ſwooning and cold ſweats, a very weak and ſmall pulſe, and if the limbs grow cold, the heart is wounded and death is not far off. If bloud iſſue out foamie and froathy, the Patient be troubled with a Cough, and hath a great difficulty in breathing, and a pain in his ſide which he had not before; if he feel a pain on the wounded ſide, yet lyes more at eaſe when he lyes upon that ſide; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lying ſo he ſpeaks in more eaſe and freedome, but turn to the contrary ſide, he preſently cannot ſpeak or with great pain and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; all theſe are ſigns that the lungs are wounded, and they are very difficult to be cured. If the Patient be taken with raving, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>delirium,</hi> Cough and ſharp pain, with difficulty of breathing and a Feaver trouble the Patient, and at ſome times through vehemency of breathing the ſtomach and guts are drawn through the wound into the Cavity of the breaſt, all theſe are ſigns that the Midriff is deadly wounded; If you perceive or underſtand bloud to be poured forth into the Cavity or hollowneſs of the breaſt, and breathing difficult, Feaver increaſing through difficulty of breathing, Vomiting bloud at the mouth, and afterward the breath ſtinks, and fainting, as alſo the Patient cannot lye upon his back, and has deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now to aſſiſt your Patient as much as you can by art in theſe wounds of the breaſt, lay your Patient naked in Bed with the wound downwards, that the matter may be diſcharged by his coughing, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54089:141"/> holding his breath, if he feel no weight in the lower part of his breaſt or be not troubled with ſpitting of bloud, uſe no tents, but drop in <hi>Arceus</hi> his Linement with Oyl of St. <hi>Johns wort</hi> compound, or ſome artificial Balſome; and upon them apply the <hi>Diapalma-plaiſter.</hi> But if there was much bloud in the cavity, and if it be caſt out, then uſe a <hi>Flamula</hi> dipt in the white of an Egg, the greater part hanging out of the wound, afterwards uſe this Injection. <hi>Take four ounces of Tiſan or Barley-water or Plantane-water, wherein you are to diſſolve two ounces of brown ſugar, and an ounce of Honey of Roſes, mix them and inject them warm with a Syringe; if you ſee ſymptoms continue, you may put in a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Pipe; till the wound runs little and good matter, then take it out and cure it up; the manner of dreſſing ſuch Patients is this, having warmed your medicine as before, cast it in with a ſyringe, which done, let your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient betake himſelf to that poſture that it may all come forth again, after put the Pipe into the wound, and lay a ſponge dipt in</hi> Aqua vitae <hi>on it, which will keep forth the aire, and draw out the matter contained in the wound; Instead of the Sponge you may make uſe of this. Take half a pound of the clear, and beſt Rozin, and two ounces of Gum-elemy, melt them over a gentle fire till they be well mixed together, then add to them Oyl of Bays and common Turpentine, of each one ounce, boyl them a little, then ſtrain them through a thick linnen cloath, which ſpread upon leather, lay it upon the Pipe which will powerfully draw matter out of the wound; Renew it once a day if in winter, and twice a day in Summer: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring always to ſnip your plaiſter in the middle, that the mater may have paſſage to flow out. With this and Artificial Balſom may wounds be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which are piercing. Forget not if you ſee occaſion to bleed firſt on the contrary ſide of the wound, and if need be and ſtrength permit, afterwards in the other arm: To diſſolve clotted bloud give this medicine inwardly, made of half a dram of Rhubarb, Madder, and Mummy, of each one ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, half a ſcruple of Sealed earth, Scabious and Buglos-water and the juice</hi> of <hi>Lemmons,</hi> of <hi>each one ounce.

Take four pound of the beſt honey; clear water and white-wine vinegar, of each one quart; boyle the water and honey into a ſyrup, afterwards add the Vinegar, then boyl it to the conſiſtance of a ſyrup, ſcumming it with a wooden ſcummer: But when the matter is coming to ſuppuration; let the patient drink half a pint of this following in the morning, which he may ſleep after, and the like quantity at four of the Clock in the afternoon. <hi>Take</hi> Eupatorie, Scabies, Sanicle, Clove-gilliflower, Privets, <hi>and</hi> Colts-foot, <hi>of each one handful; of the root of the greater Comfrey and Burridg, of each one ounce: boyl the roots firſt, then the herbs, according to Art, in five quarts of water till one half be conſumed, afterwards put to it Sugar and Honey, of each four ounces, which being clarified with the whites of two eggs keep it for uſe, which you may alſo uſe for an Injection if you pleaſe, indeavouring to get out all again, for what remains will be of a ſharp quality, and ſo may increaſe, if not beget, Symptoms.</hi>

            <p>A wound made in the lungs, if it be on the ſkirts and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, &amp;c. then giving your Patient things to hinder his coughing much and great breathing, may be cured: while the patient takes thoſe Linctus's or others before deſcribed; he is to lye on his back, for ſo the medicine will fall by little and little upon the wind-pipe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if they ſhould fall down haſtily, or in great quantity, it might cauſe the Patient to Cough: Cows Aſſes or Goats-milk, if they may be had, with a little Honey that they corrupt not in the ſtomach, are very good in theſe wounds, or the mulcians of Almonds, which is made by bruiſing the Almonds (being firſt blanched) in a ſtone-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pouring Barley-water upon them, and ſtir them well, and ſtrain through a cloth; doing this often, and it will look like milk; Sugar of Roſes likewiſe is excellent in this caſe, becauſe it is of a cleanſing and ſtrengthening quality; but when you ſhall think it time to cloſe up the wound, after you have cleanſed it with the medicines before ſpoken of, The Patient muſt uſe in Broths or Linctuſes ſome ſealed <hi>Earth, Boll-Armonack, Plantan, Knot-graſs, Shumack, Acaſia,</hi> or the Juice of <hi>Sloes,</hi> and ſuch like ſharp and binding medicines, which being mixed with Honey of Roſes, may carry away that filth which may hinder the cloſing up of the wound.</p>
            <p>Wounds happen to divers parts of the Belly, ſome whereof are piercing, as you will ſee the Guts and Caule ſometime come forth: if the great Guts come out, put them up again preſently into the Belly: But if they have been a good while out, and ſo the cold. Air hath injured them, and they be full of wind and the like, then they muſt be fomented with medicines, that will diſcuſs the wind, ſuch
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54089:142"/> as is made of Thyme and <hi>Calemint, Camomil, Mellilot, Penni-royal, Origanum, Wormwood,</hi> and the like, or elſe prick them with needles; if after all this you cannot make it go up, there is no other way but to enlarge the wound. But if the Gut it ſelf be wounded, which you will know by perceiving the excrements come forth at the wound, if it be wounded longwayes and little, it is eaſily cured, if overthwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and great, 'tis difficultly cured; if black 'tis deadly; then it muſt be ſowed up, ſo as Glovers uſe to ſtitch in making Gloves. Then put upon it powder of <hi>Maſtick, Mirrhe, Boll Armonack,</hi> and the like; after you have ſtitched it up, you muſt not put up the Gut into its place all at once, but by little and little, the patient lying on the ſide oppoſite to the wound; as if the wound be on the right ſide, the patient ſhall lie on his left, by which means you may more eaſily reſtore the Gut fallen down; if the lower part of the guts being wounded, fall through the wound, then the Patient ſhall lie low, with his head down and his buttocks raiſed higher, putting a pillow under him.</p>
            <p>If the Cawl fall out of the wound, it is to be put into his place as ſoon as may be, becauſe it is ſubject to putrefie; but if it be putrified before it can be reſtored to its place, which is when it looks black and is cold, then bind it near the warm and ſound parts, and cut off that which is corrupt, leaving the ſtring hanging out: if the colour of it be not altered, and it be warm, put it in, and ſtitch up the wound after this manner, putting your needle firſt through the ſkin and muſcles to the Peritoneum, not touching it on that ſide, and then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the needle from within, outwards, on the other-ſide, thruſt through all, and after tye it an inch further, make another ſtitch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former, and remember that you leave an Orifice for a Tent; For more ſecurity you may ſtrengthen it, if you pleaſe with a dry ſtitch; to the wound it ſelf uſe <hi>Arceus</hi> his Liniment with oyl of St. <hi>Johns wort</hi> compound, or ſome artificial <hi>Balſom,</hi> and the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often preſcribed.

            <p>If the ſtomach be wounded there follows vomiting of Choler and Hickets; ſometimes meat and drink comes forth as it is taken. If the wound be quite through the ſtomach, or near the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or if in the bottom of the ſtomach, and very great, then no hopes: if not, if the Patient be full bodyed, then let him be let blood, making him wound-drinks, as before preſcribed; if the wound be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54089:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> large, ſtitch it up, leaving only a place in the depending part, for a tent to be applyed with <hi>Balſomes;</hi> of which you have ſeveral laid down before in the cure of wounds; let the Region of the ſtomach be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the oyles of <hi>Mint, Mirtles, Roſes and Quinces, giving them firſt cleanſing gliſters, afterwards nouriſhing ones; likewiſe Broths wherein wound-herbs have been boyled.</hi>

            <p>You may know the Liver is wounded if the wound be on the right ſide, and there hath followed a flux of blood, ſometimes he vomits Choler, ſometimes caſting forth blood by ſtool and urine, and his face grow pale and wan.</p>
            <p>If the wounds of this part be not very great, having not bled much but little, they are curable as one ſays, if a peece be cut off: For cure inwardly, <hi>Take Troches of ſpodium or burnt Ivory in Plantaine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the decoction of Red Roſe leaves; To which add ſyrup of dryed Roſes and Mirtles, two ſcruples of the powder of red Roſes is very good; if blood fall down into the cavity of the Belly, and clots, diſſolve it by medicines before mentioned in wounds of the Breasts; if you perceive that Nature hath a mind to cast out the matter by urine, aſſist it by boyling Smallidg, Parſley, Fennel, and Radiſh in his Drinks or Broths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the wound be on the left ſide, and blackiſh blood iſſues out there, and he be very thirſty, then the Spleen is wounded: if the wound be ſmall it is Cureable, if deep deadly, and it is Cured as in wounds of the Liver.</p>
            <p>If the ſmall Guts be wounded, there enſues Vomiting of Choler; pain joyned with a Feaver, and meat and drink and Chile comes forth, the flanks will ſwell and be hard, and the patient will be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Hickets and ringing pains in the Belly, apt to have ſome cold-ſweats, and the outward-parts wax cold.</p>
            <p>Theſe wounds are very difficultly Cured, eſpecially if in the Gut cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jejunum,</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>the empty Gut,</hi> by reaſon many veſſels which run to it are in danger, and it ſelf is of a Nervy ſubſtance: they are to be ſtitcht with a Glovers ſtitch; after put them up, fomenting them firſt with red Wine, then upon them apply this powder: <hi>Maſtick, Sarcocol, of each one dram, Borax and Myrrhe, of each half a dram, make a powder of them for uſe, then ſtitch up the outward parts. For inward means you have ſeveral medicines preſcribed before, Maſtick is good to be taken in all things, eſpecially in the wounds of the ſtomach.</hi>

                  <hi>If there be a wound with the fracture, you muſt ſo order your buſineſs that you leave a way to dreſs the wound, and not unbind the member, but keep it firm and ſteady; which may be done after this manner; Taking ſtrong clothes that may but little more then come round the part, being three or four double, the edges of which are to over-meet at the wound, then with filtring in convenient places, tye on your ſplints, which are to be made of ſuch as they make ſword-ſcabbards of; then dreſs the wound either with Liniment of</hi> Arceus <hi>mixt with oyl of</hi> St. Johns <hi>wort compound; or elſe with this unguent following, If the bone be fowl, made of ſyrrup of dryed Roſes and Turpentine, of each two ounces, powder of the Orrice roote, Aloes, Maſtick, and Barley-flower, of each half a dram, incorporate them into an unguent; the Thigh being broken commonly knits in fourty or fifty dayes; the Arm requires not above thirty or fourty; the broken member being ſubject to ſlip aſide by turnings and the like, you are to view it often, which you may know by the Patients complaining a freſh of pain, and the unevenneſs of the part.</hi>

               <p>Sometimes there happens an inflammation, ſometimes a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, for both which you have had choice of remedies before: ſometimes itching and gaulings happen, which are cauſed from the flowing of the matter; for the which after having firſt dryed the part clear, apply, ſpread upon Paper, the white oyntment, with <hi>Camphire, unguentum tripharmacum; oyntment of Roſes and the like.</hi> Laſtly, if the member fall away, which may happen either by too ſpare a dyet, or too long binding of the part; you are to help the Patient in both theſe, by uſing good nouriſhing dyet, and comfortable things, to draw it to the part, by fomenting it with warm water, and the like, annointing the part with <hi>unguentum reſumptivum, emplaſter of Oxycro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceum and the like;</hi> where note that in fractures it is a good ſign if the Ligatures or binding be looſe on the third or fourth day.

               <p>AS for the Scurvy it is an ill diſpoſition of the body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from burnt blood and Melancholy humors cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the Body, having ſigns proper to it ſelf from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes; as Redneſs, Itch, and putrefaction of the gums, often guſhing out of bloud, which do ſometimes ſeize upon the jaws and Pallet and teeth, making them looſe and look black; thighs and legs at the beginning full of red ſpots, afterwards they become purple livid and black, they will be ſometimes in the neck and face, back and Arms, very broad; and the Party troubled with difficulty of breathing, windy ſwellings of the ſides, alſo the Midriff and Sweet-bread, as alſo with a lazy diſpoſition and dulneſs of the whole body; their urine is various, ſometimes there will be a thick ſetling like the powder of Tiles, and without any manifeſt cauſe; it will be thick and troubled to day, to morrow thin and watry; one day look pale, and another day, yellow like gold: The Pulſes ſometimes ſo weak and unequal, that one would almoſt think it ſtrange that the Patient ſhould live with ſuch a Pulſe; then again it will be great and hard without any Inflamation, and if you will obſerve it in faintings and great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which often happen, the Pulſe is ſtronger than at other times; divers Parts of the body are afflicted with pain, ſometimes with a dull pain in the thighs, ſometimes in the heel, and about the Inſtep, and the very ſoles of the feet, ſometimes the hands and the fingers ends, ſometimes the hip and knee, ſometimes much troubled with pain in the belly: thoſe pains which ſeize upon their arms thighs or legs, are very like thoſe of the French Pox; onely the difference is, that in thoſe pains where there is the French Pox, there is often hard knots and bunches; and moreover, if it be <hi>morbus gallicus</hi> there
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54089:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> will be running of the Reins and ſwelling of the groins, ſometimes they will have a pain in their ſides, ſometimes in their loyns; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will have a pain ſeize upon them in their head being more than ordinary all over the body, which vaniſheth by ſweat in the morning: they are troubled with great pains in their teeth, which are not fixed, but run up and down from one tooth to another; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will have pains in their ſides as if it were a Pluriſie, but only they have no feaver which makes the difference, and their pain does not continue but comes by fits, or their breathing is not much hurt, neither do they cough or ſpit much. As for the pain in the joynts that wanders from one joynt to another, and has often a kind of a Palſie accompanying it, for the motion of the body that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways out of order, one day being ſcarce able to ſtir one foot, the next day it may be able to walk a little, the day after not at all. With theſe pains of the joynts there is a trembling and Convulſion ſeizes upon them, ſometimes as it were the Falling-Sickneſs all over the body. Sometimes the parts are ſo drawn together they cannot be moved, ſometimes the knees only, ſometimes his Gullet ſo ſtreight, that he ſwallows his meat with great difficulty and he thinks himſelf ready to be choaked, which is cauſed from the thick vapours that do contract it. Sometimes he is troubled with flux of the belly, either with or without blood, ſtinking ſmell of the mouth, which all thoſe people that are troubled with the Scurvy, are troubled with: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have a kind of an intermitting feaver, in the beginning of the fits they are as it were pinched in divers parts, as if the fleſh were torn, eſpecially the thighs; if the diſeaſe continue long, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Patient is waſted to ſkin and bones: Now to conclude all, you muſt not think to find all theſe ſymptoms in one perſon, and at one time.</p>
               <p>The Cure of this diſeaſe in Seamen or others is chiefly or almoſt the very ſame uſed to thoſe troubled with Hypochondriack melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; ſo that you are firſt to begin the Cure with general evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Bloud-letting, Purging, and ſutable to the nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, ſtrength, and conſtitution of the Patient; for Bloud-letting, you muſt do it in the Liver-vein little and often, that you cool not the body too much at once; the next thing to be looked after is good dyet, which becauſe often wanting at Sea, in long Voyages they are to carry with them ſome ſuch comfortable things as may be uſeful; as Wine, Sugar <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then you are to adminiſter Gliſters, or Suppoſitories, ſuch as formerly has been ſpoken of in the Cure of Wounds; and afterwards ſuch a Bolus or Morſel as this following, <hi>Take of</hi> Diacatholicon <hi>and lenitive Electuary of each half an ounce, Cream of</hi> Tartar <hi>half a dram, with three or four drops of Spirit of</hi> Vite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>make a Bolus to be taken in the morning faſting, you may if you ſee the Patient weak, open the Hemrod-veins with Leeches; you may repeat

               <p>Seamen and Soldiers are often troubled with Fluxes, therefore it will not here be amiſs to lay down ſome convenient remedies for the Cure of the ſame; but being there are ſeveral kinds of Fluxes, I ſhall begin firſt with that which is called Lientery, which is when the food received into the body is caſt forth in the ſame ſubſtance colour and ſmell as it was received. This proceeds from a weakneſs of the retaining faculty of the ſtomach, when it cannot keep the meat long enough therein till it be concocted; likewiſe from a cold diſtemper of the ſtomach and liver, begetting cold and raw humours which fill up the wrinkles of the ſtomach, that it cannot keep the food it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, or elſe from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>harp humours pricking, and twitching the parts, by which the ſtomach and guts are provoked to ſend forth their meat too ſoon; If this comes from a cold cauſe, you may know it from the ſowr belching that follows, and phlegmatick excrements that are voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: If the humors come from the head the excrements are frothy and after ſleep the flux is greater; if it come by provocation cauſed by ſharp and pricking humors he will have a great thirſt, heat in his flanks, gnawing in his ſtomach, voiding ſharp and chollerick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements. If this diſeaſe come from tough phlegmatick humors cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wrinkles of the ſtomach, you muſt cut them with honey of Roſes, Oxymel ſimplex, and Oxymel-ſquils, and the like. Then you muſt give him gentle Purges, for which purpoſe Pills are the beſt, becauſe they ſtay longeſt in the ſtomach, of which you may take theſe for an example. <hi>Take of</hi> Pillulae Cochiae <hi>and</hi> Pill. Ruffi <hi>of each half a dram, mix them and make them into ſix Pills, of which let him take three at night going to bed, and the other three the next morning or night according as you ſee occaſion; or elſe Pills of</hi> Hiera <hi>with Agrick or</hi> Pillulae Alephenginae, <hi>the ſame Doſe of either a part for Glisters: they are here of no great force except the flux be violent, and then they muſt be binding, ſuch as ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter. In a Bloudy-flux after you have purged the humors offending, you muſt then ſtrengthen the ſtomach wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54089:152"/> therewith ſome few drops of the Spirit of</hi> Viteral <hi>or Sulphur: alſo ſome Marmalet of Quinces will be good, or this following, Take of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Sorrel and Wormwood of each one ounce, Conſerve of Roſes Sucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and, Buglas, of each half an ounce,</hi> Diamargariton frigidum <hi>and</hi> Diarrhodon Abbatis, <hi>of each one dram, one ſcruple of Troches of</hi> Spodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>with as much Syrrup of Lemmons as will ſerve to make them up to the form of an Electuary: mix them and let the Patient take the quantity of a</hi> Cheſnut, <hi>morning noon and night; or this following, Take ſix oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of old Conſerve of Roſes, ſix drams</hi> of <hi>London or Venice Treakle, with as much Marmalet of Quinces as will make it into an Electuary, mix them and let the Patient take about the quantity of half an ounce in the morning, drinking nothing after for the ſpace of three or four hours: if from a cold cauſe let the Patient boyl ſome Guaiacum or Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafras in his drink, of which take this for a pattern. Take of guaiacum Saſſafras, Sarſaparilla, of each two ounces, Engliſh Liquorice and Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of each one ounce, Coriander-ſeed an ounce: Infuſe them in four quarts of ſpring or running-water, twenty four hours afterwards boyl it gently to the conſumption of half of this. Let the Patient drink half a pinte at a time, about the quantity of a quart in a day: here Mithridate, Nutmeg, Diateſſaron, and Diatrion pipirion is good; if he wants reſt and the flux continue, give him three grains</hi> of Laudanum Opiatum, <hi>where note in the taking</hi> of <hi>all which things, if the Flux heing stayed break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is a ſign ill humours are to be purged away, to which purpoſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb prepared, Infuſed often in Indiff-water, is very excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next ſort of Fluxes is called <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> which is a Flux in which excremental cholerick or phlegmatick humours are caſt forth, without either blood or food; and theſe come either from the whole body, or from the brain or ſtomach, Guts, Liver, Spleen, Meſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and if in women, from the womb and the like. If the Patient hath had, or have at preſent a feaver, or be dropſical, or of an ill habit of body, or have eaten exceſſively and not digeſted his food; it is a ſign that it comes from the whole body. If the excrements be frothy and he void more by night than day, and he have ſome mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt diſeaſe in his head as a Catarrh, Lethargy, Deafneſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then it proceeds from the head. If the fault be in the ſtomach, the Patient hath eaten food apt to corrupt; and there appear ſigns that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is injured, either from a hot or cold cauſe: if from the firſt, the humours will be ſharp, cholerick, ſtinking, and nature labours to throw it out; if from the laſt, then the excrements will be crude and phlegmatick: If the Flux proceed from the Liver the excrements are cholerick, and you will perceive ſome diſtemper of the Liver, if from the Spleen they will be blackiſh, and you have ſigns of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Spleen; If from the Dyſentery, you will have an extenſion of the humours, but they come from the Liver and Spleen; if from the Guts, there's worms; if from the womb, there hath been obſtructions
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54089:153"/> of the Courſes, and now ſome ſymptom that vexes and increaſes the Flux at that time the Courſes are wont to flow; For to help this Diſeaſe, firſt of all open a vein if the body be full of bloud, and if it be not it is good to let bloud if the Patient hath a feaver, then purge with ſuch things as leave a binding quality behind them; ſuch as Rubarb dryed and given in Plantane-water, with ſyrrup of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or take a dram of Rubarb, and half a dram of the yellow Mirobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, and half a ſcruple of yellow Saunders, infuſe them in Plantane-water, ſtrain it, and to the ſtraining add half a dram of Rubarb in powder, and one ounce of Syrrup of Roſes; a potion for one doſe, or you may add the lenitive Electuary or Catholicon, according to the ſtrength and condition of the Patient and humours; vomiting is good if the body be ſtrong: before and after purging give this or the like glyſter; Take Wheat-bran and red Roſe leaves of each one pugil, whole Barley two pugils, Liquorice ſliced and Raiſins of the Sun, of each one ounce, boyl theſe in a ſufficient quantity of water till they come to a pinte, in the ſtraining diſſolve one ounce of white ſugar, and the yolks of two eggs, for a glyſter: After the body is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently emptied, then give binding Glyſters, ſuch as you ſhall find next in the cure of the Bloudy-flux: &amp; at the mouth likewiſe you ſhall there be directed. If the Patient have not a feaver, boyl new milk if you can get it, and ſcum off the foam, then quench red hot ſteel in it often, drink it warm; it is a preſent remedy. Unripe Blackberries and Mulberries dryed and powdered is good to ſtay this Flux; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this Opiat is excellent, Take of the juice of Quinces, Conſerve of Roſes, of each one ounce, Dragons bloud, ſealed-earth, and fine Bolearmonack, of each one dram, Bloud-ſtone and the Troches of Amber, of each half a dram, with ſyrrup of comphry, make an Opiat, take a little often. Or take one ounce of the powder of Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, two drams of the Troches of Sanders, mix them and give the Patient two drams thereof twice a day; this purgeth away the ill humours and ſtrengtheneth the bowels. Or this, Take half an ounce of the old Conſerve of Roſes, one dram of Marmalet of Quinces, a ſcruple of Tormentil-root in fine powder, half a ſcruple of fine Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learmonack with ſugar, make a bole for one doſe which is to be given often; if the Flux continue long and ſtrength much decay, give Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum a grain or two amongſt your other medicines; you may for ordinary drink uſe one made of three pintes of water, wherein two drams of Maſtich hath been boyled; Plantane boyled in broth is good, and for fear it turn to a Bloudy-flux, give an Emulſion of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-water and the four cold ſeeds.</p>
               <p>The laſt of the Fluxes of the belly is called <hi>Dyſenteria</hi> or the Blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-flux, which is known by the Patients voiding of bloud with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting pains; from the ulceration of the guts; by ſharp and ſalt phlegmatick and cholerick humours, which is cured by removing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54089:153"/> thoſe ſharp humours; aſſwaging pain, cleanſing and conſolidating the ulcer and ſtopping the Flux. To evacuate the humours you muſt purge with Rubarb every ſecond third or fourth day, according to the ſtrength of your Patient, ſeaſon of the year, and the like; the Doſe from half a dram to two drams, being dryed as before, or made into a Potion thus. Take Liquorice ſcraped and ſliced, Raiſins of the Sun, of each three drams, Tamarinds and yellow myrobolans, of each two drams, boyl them in Barley and Plantane-water to three ounces, in the ſtraining infuſe a dram of Rubarb thin-ſliced, then add an ounce of the ſyrrup of Roſes ſolutive, and make a potion. This following is excellent in deſperate fluxes; Take two ounces of the bark of Guiacum bruiſed and beaten, boyl it in a ſufficient quantity of water til half be waſted, then add red Roſe leaves, Pomgranate-flowers and Plantane-ſeed, of each two drams, let them boyl an hour, then to the ſtraining add a dram of Rubarb in powder, and three drams of Catholicon for a Potion; Mechoacan with Cinnamon is good. If with the Dyſentery there be a ſeaver and inflamation of the bowels, let the Patient bloud according to ſtrength; ſometimes vomiting is profitable to intercept thoſe ſharp ſalt humours that fall from the ſtomach to the Guts, omit it not if you ſee a loathing and perceive the ſtomach ſtuft full of humours: your vomiting may be this, Take from half a dram to a dram of ſalt of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> ſyrrup of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Bettony-water, of each one ounce, with ten drams of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-water, give it for one Doſe; In the mean time you muſt give mild and cleanſing Glyſters firſt, as this made of the roots of Marſh-mallows and Butter-burr, of each one handful, one pugil of Camomile-flowers, Fleabane-ſeed, and Flux-ſeed, of each two drams, Boyl them in Barley-water, or milk, or water wherein ſteel or Iron hath often been quenched, or mutton, or ſheeps-head-broath, to a pinte; ſtrain it and diſſolve therein the yolks of four eggs well beaten, oyl of Roſes and ſyrrup of Quinces of each one ounce and make a glyſter.

Take of the Roots of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, Tormentil, and Biſtort, of each one ounce, Plantane, Shepherd-Purſe, Knot-graſs, and Mouſe-ear, of each one handful, Pumpranet-flowers, Acorn-cups, Cyprus-nuts, of each one dram; parched Rice, French Barley, and red Roſes, of each one pugil; boyl them in Smiths water, or water wherein Iron hath often been quenched.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54089:154"/> To a pinte of the ſtraining add of the juice of Plantane and Yarrow of each one ounce, and the yolks of two roaſted eggs; Or inſtead of the juices you may uſe the muſcilage of Gum Draganth, made with Roſe or Plantane-water, and Goats or Deer-ſuet of each one dram. All this while you muſt not forget internal remedies; to ſtay the flux nutmegs are excellent, if deſperate, dryed and burnt to powder, Rice pottage, or this, Take of ſealed-Earth, Harts-horn prepared with Plantane and Knot-graſs-water, prepared Corral, <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> of each one dram, mix them, the Doſe is from a ſcruple to one dram, in Knot-graſs or Plantane-water, one dram of crude Allum given in the ſaid waters doth in a manner charm the flux. Or take a pinte of ſyrrup of Prunes without Sugar, a ſpoonful and half of Tormentil-root in powder, boyl them a little together, and drink a quarter of a pinte firſt and laſt. Laſtly the Body being well cleanſed before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make this binding Decoction to compleat the Cure. <hi>Take the roots of Biſtort, Comfrey, and Tormentil, the leaves of Plantane, Tarrow, Shepherds purſe, Horſe-tail, Mouſe-ear, and Agrimony, of each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Seeds of Sorrel, Grape-ſtones, and Sumach, of each one ounce, boyl them in four quarts of water till half be conſumed; then strain it and ſweeten it with ſyrrup of Comfrey, Quinces, Mirtles, dryed Roſes, and Corral: or elſe make uſe of this following Opiat,</hi> Take of Conſerve of Quinces, and Conſerve of old Roſes, of each one ounce, half an ounce of the Conſerves of Comfrey-roots, prepared Corral, Dragons-bloud, Bolarmenick, ſealed-earth, Conſerve of Slowes, <hi>Acatia,</hi> of each one dram; <hi>Spodium,</hi> burnt Ivory, of each one ſcruple; with as much of any of the Syrrups aforeſaid as will make it to an Opiat.
